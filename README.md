## 1. The Display
When you open the website, you'll notice an object has been created for you.
It will look like a red circle in the middle of the grid.
If there is no object, you can press the add button or the a key on your keyboard to create one.
After adding an object, click somewhere on the grid to comfirm its initial location.
You can create as many objects as you like, but keep in mind that with too many objects (more than 10) performance will be affected.

There are a number of ways that you can change an object with the display alone.
